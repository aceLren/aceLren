# Painting and Code

Painting, writing music, dance (watching though, I'm practically the antithesis of grace), movies, poetry - for years this, for me, was life; I'd always been good with quantitative study but it was the art that was my muse.

About 8 years ago I learned to code. In my way I saw that as art as well; the beauty and precision of something well crafted mesmerized me. The determinism was a deleterious delirium.

I began to wish life had an undo stack and to live that way, but life isn't deterministic. No amount of control or planning can guarantee an outcome, and the more I tried the less it worked. Love and control don't coexist, and art is love.

Recently I began writing music again. And painting. When the music demands a different progression, I move. When the piece requires old strokes to be painted over with new, I comply. The beauty is in not having undo, the beauty is in watching a piece unfold with strokes and chords. In watching something change until it becomes what it was meant to be, not in spite of the mistakes but because of them.

Suddenly life is art again because instead of trying to force what I thought it should be into existence I am finally seeing what has always been there. Surrender is so difficult.
